#  Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction detection in real time using Kafka

Utilized SparkML and Scikit-Learn to develop and train several machine learning
models for distinguishing fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
The machine learning models are then utilized to make predictions on Kafka-generated real-time data streams. 
Built an interface for displaying these predictions in real time using Streamlit framework.
